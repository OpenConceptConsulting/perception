We have more than fifteen years of history of serving the federal government, including undertaking the biggest accessibility program that's occurred in the United States government or anywhere. Deque also works with .edu's and mission-focused nonprofits to ensure that their materials and systems are usable and barrier free for users with disabilities. The company invented the first accessibility plug-in software, the first web-based testing platform, and the first server-based accessibility solution. All of these have been created in the service of helping our customers become accessible, advance the goals of their organization, and remove barriers for all users on the web.","866","5346","","0","Deque Systems","13","","0","How Deque University is Changing Lives","38","A11y Hacks for the Blind: Navigating GitHub & the W3C","53","index, follow","index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1","","","https://www.deque.com/blog/author/deque-systems/page/5/","https://www.deque.com/blog/author/deque-systems/page/6/","https://www.deque.com/blog/author/deque-systems/page/4/","","","88020","637","8.577","4","1","21","7","0.280","162","82","","","","","","","8937a88985e129a39b9d2901ec1b31c3","10.767","","","","https://www.deque.com/blog/author/deque-systems/page/5/"

We have more than fifteen years of history of serving the federal government, including undertaking the biggest accessibility program that's occurred in the United States government or anywhere. Deque also works with .edu's and mission-focused nonprofits to ensure that their materials and systems are usable and barrier free for users with disabilities. The company invented the first accessibility plug-in software, the first web-based testing platform, and the first server-based accessibility solution. All of these have been created in the service of helping our customers become accessible, advance the goals of their organization, and remove barriers for all users on the web.","866","5346","","0","Deque Systems","13","","0","Could Your Company’s Videos Get You Sued for ADA Noncompliance?","63","United States Access Board Proposes Rule Changes to Section 508","63","index, follow","index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1","","","https://www.deque.com/blog/author/deque-systems/page/7/","https://www.deque.com/blog/author/deque-systems/page/8/","https://www.deque.com/blog/author/deque-systems/page/6/","","","87332","615","8.766","4","1","21","7","0.280","161","84","","","","","","","b207ec83005a38233404acf6cff8e2d7","15.794","","","","https://www.deque.com/blog/author/deque-systems/page/7/"
