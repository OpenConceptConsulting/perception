The NDDB \noperates \nfor the benefit of the entire law enforcement community within Canada. \nIn \n2014\n  the Government of Canada \namended \nthe \nDNA Identification Act\n to establish \nfive new \nDNA \nindexes\n in the NDDB\n: the \nVictims Index (VI)  the \nVoluntary Donors Index (VDI)  the Missing Persons Index\n (MPI)\n  \nthe \nHuman Remains Index\n (HRI)\n and \nthe \nRelatives of Missing Persons Index\n (RMI)\n. The\n MPI  HRI and RMI \nwere created for \nthe \nhumanitarian purposes\n of investigating missing persons and human \nremains\n (refer \nto \nthe \nInvestigator\xe2\x84\xa2s Guide to the National Missing Persons DNA Program\n).

The\n NDDB will not \naccept\n a DNA profile \nfor inclusion \ninto the VI or VDI \nwithout the proper written consent \nfrom \neach person donating a sample for submission \ninto either of \nthese \nindexes\n. If \na victim of \na designated offence \ncannot be found  \nis \nunidentified  \nis \ndeceased\n  or \nis \notherwise \nunable to consent to submitting \na biological\n sample\n  their DNA profile may be obtained \nby the \ninvestigator \nfrom their remains  their personal effects\n  or from any place associated with the \ncommission of the designated offence.\n '[ PAGE 3 END ][ PAGE 4 START ]  Guide to the Victims Index and Voluntary Donors Index \nof the National DNA Data Bank\n of Canada\n   Version \n1.0\n Effective Date: 201\n8-03-06 Page \n4 of \n7  Other general co\nnsiderations:\n  The investigator must assess whether the donor understand\ns the purpose for providing \na biological \nsample\n  as well as\n what will be done with that sample and the associated\n DNA profile developed \nfrom it.\n  If the donor is under the age of 18  con\nsent \nmay\n be provided by a parent/\nlegal \nguardian. The donor \nwill have the opportunity to provide their own consent \nwithin one year \nafter they reach the age of 18 \nif they decide to have their DNA profile remain in the \nNDDB.\n  Investigators are encouraged to \nread and familiarize themselves with the appropriate consent forms.\n  4 SAMPLE COLLECTION AN\nD CONSENT\n A criminal \ninvestigation \nmay lead to the submission of\n a DNA profile to the NDDB \nwhen\n a victim \nof a \ndesignated offence \nor an individual voluntarily donates their DNA. \nThe\n developed \nVI or \nVDI profile will \nbe submitted \nto the NDDB \nby \na public forensic \nlaboratory \nthat\n has \nauthorized access to CODIS\n (Combined DNA Index System\n)  the software \nused to retain and \ncompare\n DNA profiles\n. These \nauthorized \nlaboratories are\n: the \nCentre of Forensic Sciences in Toronto and Sault Ste. Marie\n; the \nLaboratoire de \nsciences judiciaires et de m\xc3\xa9decine l\xc3\xa9gale in Montreal\n; and the RCMP\n\xe2\x84\xa2s\n National Forensic Laboratory \nServices in Vancouver \n Edmonton and Ottawa. \n Investigators must collect \na biological sample \nand\n written \nconsent\n for\n each \nvoluntary \ndonor\n. The \nconsent may be obtained after the initial analysis of the \nbiological \nsamples \nby \nthe public forensic \nlaboratory\n  but \nthe consent \nmust be \nobtained\n before\n any DNA profile from a victim or voluntary donor\n is \nsubmitted \nto the NDDB\n. The consent must be obtained on the form entitled \xef\xac\x81\nNational DNA Data Bank \nConsent\n to Provide \nBiological S\namples\n \xc5\x92 Consent for a Voluntary Donor\n\xef\xac\x82 or \n\xef\xac\x81National DNA Dat\na Bank \nConsent to Provide Biological Samples \n\xc5\x92 Consent for a \nVictim\n\xef\xac\x82. Otherwise  the DNA profile derived \nfrom the \ncollected biological \nsample \nwill not be accepted \nfor entry into the VI or VDI\n by the NDDB\n. If \nthe \nvictim of \nthe \ndesignated offence \nis \nunidentified  deceased\n  unable to consent to submitting their bodily \nsubstance\n  or if their whereabouts are unknown  their DNA profile may be obtained from their remains  \ntheir personal effects\n  or from any place associated with the commission of the desig\nnated offence.\n Circumstances may arise where a DNA profile \nhas been previously developed from a victim or volunteer \ndonor \nby a public forensic laboratory for a\n criminal investigation\n prior to the \namendments to the \nDNA \nIdentification Act\n and the establishme\nnt of \nthe \nVI and VDI indexes in the NDDB.\n In such cases\n  an existing \nVI or\n VDI \nDNA profile\n can\n be \nentered into\n the \nNDDB \nso long as\n written \nconsent\n is obtained from the \ndonor\n. One of the\n above noted \nconsent \nform\ns must\n be used.\n  5 THE \nPROCESSING \nOF BIOLOGICAL \nSAMPLES\n A biological \nsample collected from \na victim \nor a \nvoluntary donor as part of a criminal investigation \nmust \nbe sent to \none of the CODIS participating\n public forensic laborator\nies \n(as \nnoted above\n) to develop\n the \nDNA profile. These submissions will fol\nlow the same protocols in place for \nthe submission of \nDNA \nprofiles derived \nfrom crime scene\n samples\n. The public forensic laborator\nies are\n accredited for this type \nof DNA analysis and \nwill make the\n request \nto enter the resulting\n DNA\n profile \ninto the VI or V\nDI index \nof\n the NDDB\n as \nappropriate\n.

Di\xcb\x9aerent drugs have di\xcb\x9aerent e\xcb\x9aects on \nyour brain and body  and can impair the ability to \n\ndrive by:\n \xcb\x9bSlowing or increasing reaction time\n \xcb\x9bIncreasing sleepiness\n \xcb\x9bReducing the ability to handle unexpected events\n \xcb\x9bImpairing short-term memory\n \xcb\x9bImpairing concentration\n \xcb\x9bReducing the ability to divide attention\n \xcb\x9bCausing a poor time and space perception\n \xcb\x9bImpairing judgment and decision-making\n \xcb\x9bIncreasing risk-taking behaviour\n \xcb\x9bImpairing balance and coordination\nHere are seven categories of drugs which can \n\nimpair drivers and some of their potential e\xcb\x9aects:\nCentral nervous system depressants\ne.g.  Xanax  Ativan  E\xcb\x9cexor  Paxil  Valium\nCentral nervous system depressants slow down \n brain activity  cause drowsiness and can cause \n \nslurred speech. \xcb\x9cey can also cause slow \n\nuncoordinated movements.   \nHallucinogens e.g.  LSD  ecstasy  mescaline  psilocybin\nHallucinogens can distort sensory messages to the \nbrain\xc5\xa0they can alter taste  sight  hearing  smell \n\nand feeling. \xcb\x9cese drugs can impair decision-\n\nmaking  memory  perception and the ability to \n\ncontrol speed and adapt to change.\nCentral nervous system stimulantse.g.  cocaine  meth  crystal meth  speed  Ritalin \nStimulants accelerate and excite the brain and the \nbody. \xcb\x9cis may result in the inability to focus and \n\ndivide attention  and an increase in risk-taking.\nNarcotic analgesics \ne.g.  oxycodone  fentanyl  heroin  methadone  codeine \nA driver under the e\xcb\x9aects of narcotic analgesics \nmay be drowsy  drive slower  have pinpoint pupils  \n\nbreathe slowly  weave in and out of lanes  have \n\npoor vehicle control and delayed reaction times.\nCannabis/Marijuanae.g.  hashish  cannabis oil  hash oil  shatter  budder  \n\nwax  dabs  kief  edibles  tinctures  creams  pot \nCannabis use a\xcb\x9aects cognitive and motor abilities. \n\xcb\x9cis can result in a reduced ability to divide \n\nattention  fatigue  stress  poor time and space \n\nperception  and di\xcb\x9dculty concentrating. \xcb\x9ce \n\ne\xcb\x9aects of cannabis depend on several factors  such \nas the type of cannabis used  how the cannabis is \n\ningested and how much a person takes.\nDissociative anestheticse.g.  PCP  ketamine  dextromethorphan (DXM)\nDissociative anesthetics can cause cyclic \nunresponsive behaviours  hallucinations and an \n\nincreased body temperature.  \nInhalantse.g.  gasoline  whippits  computer air duster  nitrous \n\noxide  other volatile solvents\nInhalants can cause bloodshot eyes  severe \nconfusion  \xcb\x99ushed face  extremely poor \n\ncoordination and severe intoxication. With \n\nprolonged use  they can also cause permanent \n\nbrain damage.  \nImpaired Driving and the Law\nImpaired driving  whether caused by drugs (even if \n\nprescribed by a doctor)  alcohol or a combination \n\nof both  is illegal and can result in a criminal \n\no\xcb\x9aence under the \nCriminal Code of Canada\n. It\xe2\x84\xa2s \nillegal to operate any type of motor vehicles while \n\nimpaired  including cars  boats  all-terrain vehicles \n\n(ATV)  snowmobiles  and scooters (gas or electric).\nPolice o\xcb\x9dcers are trained to detect drug-impaired \ndriving using roadside Standard Field Sobriety \n\xc2\xa9 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada  as \nrepresented by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  2019.\n\nCat.

Check your provincial or territorial \n\nlaws for information on the consequences of \n\nimpaired driving in your area.\nPrevention\nTo help young people make informed choices \n \nand reduce the risks associated with drug-\n\nimpaired driving:\n \xcb\x9bBe a positive role model;\n \xcb\x9bKnow the facts! Young people are doing their \n\nown research  especially online\xc5\xa0not all of \n\nwhat they \xcb\x86nd is true;\n \xcb\x9bTalk with youth openly and honestly about \n \nthe harms  consequences and dangers of \n \ndrug-impaired driving;\n \xcb\x9bProvide youth with alternatives to driving \n\nimpaired or getting in the car with someone who \n\nis. For example: \n \xc2\xbbDesignate a driver;\n \xc2\xbbUse alternative modes of transportation \n\n(public transportation  taxi  friend or \n\nfamily member);\n \xc2\xbbStay the night if possible and safe to do so.\n \xcb\x9bActively encourage youth to drive sober and to \n\nmake healthy life choices that will enable them to \n\nreach their personal goals.\nFor More Information\nRCMP Centre for Youth Crime Prevention\n\nrcmp-grc.gc.ca/cycp-cpcj\nCanadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction\nccsa.ca\nGovernment of Canada\ncanada.ca/cannabis\nIn collaboration with:\nCanadian Association of Chiefs of PoliceSafety and security for all Canadians through innovative police leadership'[ PAGE 1 END ]"
